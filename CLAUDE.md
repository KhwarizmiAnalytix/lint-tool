# lint-tool

Python package providing lintrunner adapters. First-party code lives
in `src/lint_tool/`, tests in `tests/`. Support Python 3.9+ as declared in
`pyproject.toml`. Preserve the `lint-tool` entry point, adapter output
protocols, exit-code behavior, and package JSON resources. Host repositories
own their lint policies; do not introduce a private host-project dependency.

## Shared agent guidance

Adapted from the public [XSigma rules and skills](https://github.com/KhwarizmiAnalytix/XSigma/tree/89848c54492abef57fd0d0dc53b9da96b7cd1d5d)
at revision `89848c54492abef57fd0d0dc53b9da96b7cd1d5d`. Local API, dependency, language, and build
conventions below specialize that guidance for this standalone repository.

Read the applicable rules before editing. They apply to Claude as well as
Augment; C++ rules apply only when working on C++:

- [C++ coding](.augment/rules/coding.md) and [builders](.augment/rules/builder.md)
- [Python](.augment/rules/python.md)
- [Testing](.augment/rules/testing.md) and [builds](.augment/rules/build%20rule.md)
- [Dependencies](.augment/rules/ThirdParty.md)
- [Portability](.augment/rules/must-have.md) and [documentation](.augment/rules/markdown.md)

Use these task-specific skills as needed:

- [project-build](.claude/skills/project-build/SKILL.md): configure, build, and test
- [new-test](.claude/skills/new-test/SKILL.md): add tests using local conventions
- [clang-tidy](.claude/skills/clang-tidy/SKILL.md): analyze first-party C++ when applicable
- [session-checklist](.claude/skills/session-checklist/SKILL.md): verify completed work

## Build and test

Run from the repository root in the active development environment:

```sh
python -m pip install -e ".[test]"
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

CI runs pytest on Python 3.9 through 3.12. The package currently has no
CMake/Bazel build or repository lintrunner configuration. Use
`pyproject.toml` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` as the source of truth;
do not add C++ build scaffolding or an unsolicited formatter configuration.

## Test conventions

Follow existing pytest cases under `tests/` with `test_*.py` names.
Use temporary files and mock tool invocations to cover adapter output,
missing executables, and failures. Do not require every external linter to
be installed merely to run the adapter unit tests.

## Verification and scope

For non-trivial source or build changes, run affected tests, review the diff,
and run configured lint/static-analysis checks relevant to touched files.
Check both build systems where provided. Follow the session checklist and
report checks run, failures, and unavailable tools explicitly. Guidance-only
changes need frontmatter/link/whitespace validation, not compilation.

Keep unrelated user edits and dependency sources intact. Share review
findings in the response or pull request; do not create unsolicited status
documents. Follow this repository's existing license and contribution policy.
