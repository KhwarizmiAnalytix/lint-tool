# clang-tidy

Read [CLAUDE.md](../../../CLAUDE.md), local `.clang-tidy` files where
present, and the build/linter configuration before choosing the invocation.

This repository contains a Python package, not first-party C++
translation units. clang-tidy does not lint Python. For ordinary package
changes, use its pytest workflow and configured Python checks instead.

If the task specifically concerns clang-tidy integration with a C++ host
repository, inspect that host's configuration and compilation database.
Do not add a CMake build or claim to have analyzed C++ in this package.

For an applicable C++ analysis:

- Use a clang-tidy version compatible with the compiler and standard library
  that produced `compile_commands.json`. Missing system headers often
  indicate a toolchain or database mismatch rather than a source defect.
- Confirm the compilation database includes each selected translation unit.
  Check headers through source files that include them; an absent database
  entry or skipped file is not a successful analysis.
- Scope fixes to the requested first-party code. Preserve unrelated working
  changes and inspect the diff after any automatic rewrite.
- Investigate a finding before suppressing it. Prefer a narrowly scoped
  suppression with its reason; directory configurations should retain parent
  settings. Do not disable checks globally to silence one false positive.
- Leave vendored code unchanged. Report findings separately from setup
  failures and state the actual files/configurations analyzed.
